1) how many apps outside of labs and lecture? hmmmmmmm well we had our projects so 3 and then also I've done a few extra maybe 3 or 4 extra
2) why not more? I feel like I don't really have time with all the labs ad content to learn in school like i started a recipe app from youtube, I like youtube tutorials, but I havent touched it since the first day I started it bc Ive been doing stuff here in school like the labs but that was my next plan when I was done w them
3) difference between state and props: state is the lifecycle of each component and props is the attributes they inherit from their parent components
4) when use state vs props? props are used when you want to get the attributes so like if theres an array of objects in one file you would use this.props to get them and state is used when something changes about that component like an event
5) when should we use constructor to create state? umm i think it was like u have to use it with ES5 so any browser thats older
6) how do we pass props? {this.whateverunamedtheobject.props}
7 bonus) how do we change a components state from outside the component? tbh i dont know the answer to this even tho i did the labs i cant remember if u change it from outside or not
